# chordDiagrams
chordDiagrams is a software package to do computations in the vector space spanned by chord diagram of framed links (modulo 4T relation). Requires Mathematica.

[Vassiliev Invarinats](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/VassilievInvariant.html) of knots are a relatively new and interesting tool to distinguish mathematical [knots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_%28mathematics%29).

The problem of classification of knots remains open, and there are a lot of open questions regarding the invariants.

Vassiliev Invariants are ultimately defined by chord diagrams modulo certain relations, about which one can read in [the great book on the subject](http://www.math.cinvestav.mx/~mostovoy/cdbook/cdbook-final-draft.pdf).

This software project aims to explore the vector space of chord digrams of framed links modulo the 4T relations, compute bases for various dimensions (up to 5 at this moment), and find bases with interesting properties.

The results of computations done with this software ultimately led to [this publication](http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3253).
